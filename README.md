Python Web App
==============

A proof of concept for a deployable web app in Python.

Goals
-----

- learn what it takes to deploy a small we app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
- get a feeling of how its files could be organized in Python
- give a try to [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)

Usage
-----

- the application is configured with a given color
- every time you visit the web page (or click a button?) you get a different number and the color that was chosen

Development
-----------

- activate the [virtual environment](http://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/installation/#activate-the-environment)
- install the dependencies
- run the test suite
- pick a color, configure the application to use it
- run the application locally
- deploy to Heroku using a [Heroku button](https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-button)
- make changes, contribute ideas, have fun!
